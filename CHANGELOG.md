# Changelog

All notable changes to cfspopcon will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **JCH profile algorithms** — `calc_jch_profiles`, `calc_jch_pedestal_peaking`. (#139)
- **Profile-selection composite algorithms** — `calc_peaking_and_analytic_profiles`, `calc_peaking_and_prf_profiles`. (#139)
- **Radial-grid algorithm** — `define_radial_grid`, which provides `rho`. (#139)

### Changed

- **Profile form is selected by algorithm** — list a `calc_peaking_and_*_profiles` composite instead of setting the `density_profile_form` / `temp_profile_form` inputs. (#139)
- **`calc_analytic_profiles`, `calc_prf_profiles` algorithms** now take `rho` as an input and no longer return it; the `npoints` argument is removed. (#139)

### Removed

- **`calc_peaked_profiles`, `calc_1D_plasma_profiles` algorithms** — replaced by `calc_peaking_and_analytic_profiles` / `calc_peaking_and_prf_profiles`. (#139)
- **`density_profile_form`, `temp_profile_form` inputs** — and with them, mixed density/temperature profile forms. (#139)
