algorithms:
  # The POPCON algorithm starts by selecting an average density
  # and temperature, which defines a stored energy stored_energy. From this,
  # we can compute P_in from stored_energy and a tau_e scaling.

  # Once we have P_in (=P_loss in steady-state), we want to split
  # it into components. For this, we need to estimate 1D plasma
  # profiles in the confined region.

  # Once we have the profiles, we can then estimate the power
  # radiated from the confined region.

  - require_P_rad_less_than_P_in
  # To control the power crossing the separatrix, we can inject
  # a core radiator (high-Z species like Xenon) to intentionally
  # increase the power radiated from the core. This increases
  # the fuel dilution and Zeff (computed), as well as degrading
  # core confinement (not yet computed).
  - calc_extrinsic_core_radiator
  # We then recompute the profiles with the dilution due to the
  # core radiator, and use this to determine the fusion power rate.

  # Once we have the power input into and radiated from the confined
  # region, we can determine the power crossing the separatrix. We use
  # a scaling for lambda_q to calculate a corresponding q_parallel, and
  # then use the two-point-model to determine how much edge seeding we
  # require to protect the divertor.

  # Finally, we calculate several parameters which aren't used in other

  # space, such as regions with f_Greenwald >~ 1.0 or where P_SOL < P_LH.
