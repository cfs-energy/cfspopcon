Getting Started
===================

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cfspopcon package is available on the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`, thus installation is as simple as:

.. code::

  >>> pip install cfspopcon
  >>> radas -d ./radas_dir

The second step is to generate a folder of OpenADAS atomic data files. We can't ship these files with
cfsPOPCON due to licensing issues, but they're easy to make with `radas`. You only need to do this once.

Example Notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example notebook linked below can be found within the `docs folder <https://github.com/cfs-energy/cfspopcon/blob/main/docs/doc_sources/getting_started.ipynb>`_ of our github repository.
