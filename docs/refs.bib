	abstract = {Radiation and charge-exchange losses in the PLT tokamak are compared for discharges with Ohmic heating only (OH), and with additional heating by neutral beams (NB) or RF in the ion cyclotron frequency range (ICRF). Spectroscopic, bolometric and soft-X-ray diagnostics were used. The effects of discharge cleaning, vacuum wall gettering, and rate of gas inlet on radiation losses from OH plasmas and the correlation between radiation from plasma core and edge temperatures are discussed. – For discharges with neutral-beam injection the radiation dependence on type of injection (e.g. co-injection versus counter- and co- plus counter-injection) was investigated. Radial profiles of radiation loss were compared with profiles of power deposition. Although total radiation was in the range of 30–60\% of total input power into relatively clean plasma, nevertheless only 10–20\% of the total central input power to ions and electrons was radiated from the plasma core. The radiated power was increased mainly by increased influx of impurities, however, a fraction of this radiation was due to the change in charge-state distribution associated with charge-exchange recombination. – During ICRF heating radiation losses were higher than or comparable to those experienced during co- plus counter-injection at similar power levels. At these low power levels of ICRF heating the total radiated power was ∼ 80\% of auxiliary-heating power. Radiation losses changed somewhat less rapidly than linearly with ICRF power input up to the maximum available at the time of these measurements (0.65 MW).},

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {If correct, the Lengyel model offers a simple and powerful tool to predict the conditions required for detachment onset in future fusion reactors. We assess its validity against a comprehensive SOLPS-4.3 simulation database of ITER baseline (Q = 10) neon-seeded plasmas (Pacher et al 2015 J. Nucl. Mater. 463 591). In absolute terms, the Lengyel Model is found to significantly overpredict the simulated impurity concentration required in the ITER outer divertor for outer target ion flux rollover (by a factor ∼4.3 in this particular case). Importantly though, at detachment onset, and even beyond onset, the Lengyel model does give a remarkably accurate prediction of the scaling interdependencies between the electron density at the outer divertor entrance, the parallel energy flux density at the outer divertor entrance, and the impurity concentration in the outer divertor. However, the generalisation of these two key results to other machines, and in the presence of additional physics not included in these simulations, requires further studies. The analysis techniques described here provide a framework for such studies. Regarding the factor ∼4.3 overprediction of the simulated outer divertor impurity concentration, the main contributors to the disagreement are found to be other energy loss mechanisms besides impurity cooling (primarily neutral losses and radial transport) combined with convective energy fluxes near the target, as well as non-constant electron static pressure due to poloidally variable T i/T e. None of these are included in the Lengyel model. By themselves, these do not strongly influence the scaling interdependencies of the main Lengyel parameters over the explored parameter range. The impurity residence time τ is observed to increase with density, which tends to flatten out the impurity concentration scaling at low density, relative to the Lengyel model (which usually assumes constant τ). In these simulations, however, this flattening out was cancelled by an accumulation of other effects, so that the scaling prediction of the Lengyel model was still well met. A simple physics model is derived for n e τ that matches the simulation data well. Neon is found to migrate from the inner divertor to the outer divertor with increased puffing, thereby increasing the outer divertor neon enrichment. At outer target ion flux rollover, though, the enrichment is approximately independent of the upstream concentration, so that the Lengyel model predicts well the scaling dependency between the upstream impurity concentration and the upstream electron density, both key quantities dictating the operational range of a tokamak.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {The efficient operation of a tokamak is limited by several constraints, such as the transition to high confinement or the density limits occurring in both confinement regimes. These particular boundaries of operation are derived in terms of a combination of dimensionless parameters describing interchange-drift-Alfvén turbulence without any free adjustable parameter. The derived boundaries describe the operational space at the separatrix of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, which is presented in terms of an electron density and temperature existence diagram. The derived density limits are compared against Greenwald scaling. The power threshold and role of ion heat flux for the transition to high confinement are discussed.}

title = {The power dependence of the maximum achievable H-mode and (disruptive) L-mode separatrix density in ASDEX Upgrade},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {In future fusion reactors disruptions must be avoided at all costs. Disruptions due to the density limit (DL) are typically described by the power-independent Greenwald scaling. Recently, a power dependence of the disruptive DL was predicted by several authors (Zanca et al 2019 Nucl. Fusion 59 126011; Giacomin et al 2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 185003; Singh and Diamond 2022 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 64 084004; Stroth et al 2022 Nucl. Fusion 62 076008; Brown and Goldston 2021 Nucl. Mater. Energy 27 101002). It is investigated whether this increases the operational range of the tokamak. Increasing the heating power in the L-mode can induce an L-H transition, and therefore a power-dependent DL and the L-H transition cannot be considered independently. The different models are tested on a data base for separatrix parameters at the separatrix of ASDEX Upgrade and compared with the concept (SepOS) presented in Eich and Manz (2021 Nucl. Fusion 61 086017). The disruptive separatrix density scales with the power  in good agreement to all models. Also the back transition from high to low (H-L) confinement shows an approximately Greenwald scaling with an additional power dependence  according to the SepOS concept. For future devices operating at much higher heating power such a power scaling may allow operation at much higher separatrix densities than are common in H-mode operation. Preconditions to extrapolation for future devices are discussed.}

title = {Turbulence driven widening of the near-SOL power width in ASDEX Upgrade H-Mode discharges},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {Divertor heat flux data from infra red (IR) from various tokamaks in H-Mode regime show that the power width, , scales approximately like 1.6 (R/a) ρs,pol. However, the IR based scaling comes with the restriction that only discharges were considered with attached divertor conditions. Here we set up a new data base covering low edge density data but also including high density plasmas reaching the H-mode density limit. We use Thomson-scattering to measure the electron temperature decay length which will set the near-SOL power width through parallel heat conduction. We present scaling results for the density, temperature and pressure separatrix fall-off lengths. As the principal result we derive a generalized power width scaling which reads as  where  describes a normalized collisionality (). The parameter  describes the relative importance of the interchange effect on drift-wave turbulence as proposed by Scott and is found to be closely linked to the diamagnetic parameter αd introduced by Rogers, Drake and Zeiler (RDZ). The edge operational space for ASDEX Upgrade displays a boundary qualitatively in agreement with the region labelled as density limit in the edge plasma phase space proposed by RDZ. The data base shows in the limit of low edge densities () accurate agreement to the IR based power width scaling. At elevated separatrix densities () the power width is broadened by a factor of up to about three accompanied by a reduction of the H98,y2 confinement factor. Plasmas with higher triangularity show higher values for H98,y2 in the same range of normalized collisionality.}

title = {Analysis and expansion of the quasi-continuous exhaust (QCE) regime in ASDEX Upgrade},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {The quasi-continuous exhaust (QCE) regime, formerly known as either type-II ELM or small ELM regime is studied in ASDEX Upgrade. The regime is a natural type-I ELM-free H-mode. The operational space of QCE discharges in ASDEX Upgrade with respect to their separatrix conditions and their power exhaust capabilities are presented. A significant broadening of the power fall-off length is observed, correlating to an increased separatrix density and pressure. Moreover, the possible reactor relevance of this regime is demonstrated by expanding the operational space to low edge safety factor and demonstrating the benign tungsten impurity behaviour. A discharge without any type-I ELM from start to end reaching a partially detached divertor at high normalised energy confinement time is presented.}
