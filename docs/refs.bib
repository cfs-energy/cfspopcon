Spectroscopic, bolometric and soft-X-ray diagnostics were used. The effects of discharge cleaning, vacuum wall gettering, and rate of gas inlet on radiation losses from OH plasmas and the correlation between radiation from plasma core and edge temperatures are discussed. – For discharges with neutral-beam injection the radiation dependence on type of injection (e.g. co-injection versus counter- and co- plus counter-injection) was investigated. Radial profiles of radiation loss were compared with profiles of power deposition. Although total radiation was in the range of 30–60\% of total input power into relatively clean plasma, nevertheless only 10–20\% of the total central input power to ions and electrons was radiated from the plasma core. The radiated power was increased mainly by increased influx of impurities, however, a fraction of this radiation was due to the change in charge-state distribution associated with charge-exchange recombination. – During ICRF heating radiation losses were higher than or comparable to those experienced during co- plus counter-injection at similar power levels. At these low power levels of ICRF heating the total radiated power was ∼ 80\% of auxiliary-heating power. Radiation losses changed somewhat less rapidly than linearly with ICRF power input up to the maximum available at the time of these measurements (0.65 MW).},

This ELM-free regime features high energy confinement and a steep temperature pedestal, while particle confinement remains at L-mode levels, giving stationary density and avoiding impurity accumulation. I-mode has now been obtained over nearly all of the magnetic fields and currents possible in this high field tokamak (Ip 0.55–1.7 MA, BT 2.8–8 T) using a configuration with B  ×  ∇B drift away from the X-point. Results at 8 T confirm that the L–I power threshold varies only weakly with BT, and that the power range for I-mode increases with BT; no 8 T discharges transitioned to H-mode. Parameter dependences of energy confinement are investigated. Core transport simulations are giving insight into the observed turbulence reduction, profile stiffness and confinement improvement. Pedestal models explain the observed stability to ELMs, and can simulate the observed weakly coherent mode. Conditions for I–H transitions have complex dependences on density as well as power. I-modes have now been maintained in near-DN configurations, leading to improved divertor power flux sharing. Prospects for I-mode on future fusion devices such as ITER and ARC are encouraging. Further experiments on other tokamaks are needed to improve confidence in extrapolation.}

A weak dependence of the power threshold for the L-I transition on the toroidal magnetic field strength is found. During improved confinement, the edge radial electric field well deepens. Stability calculations show that the I-mode pedestal is peeling-ballooning stable. Turbulence investigations reveal strongly intermittent density fluctuations linked to the weakly coherent mode in the confined plasma, which become stronger as the confinement quality increases. Across all investigated structure sizes (–12 cm−1, with  the perpendicular wavenumber of turbulent density fluctuations), the intermittent turbulence bursts are observed. Comparison with bolometry data shows that they move poloidally toward the X-point and finally end up in the divertor. This might be indicative that they play a role in inhibiting the density profile growth, such that no pedestal is formed in the edge density profile.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {If correct, the Lengyel model offers a simple and powerful tool to predict the conditions required for detachment onset in future fusion reactors. We assess its validity against a comprehensive SOLPS-4.3 simulation database of ITER baseline (Q = 10) neon-seeded plasmas (Pacher et al 2015 J. Nucl. Mater. 463 591). In absolute terms, the Lengyel Model is found to significantly overpredict the simulated impurity concentration required in the ITER outer divertor for outer target ion flux rollover (by a factor ∼4.3 in this particular case). Importantly though, at detachment onset, and even beyond onset, the Lengyel model does give a remarkably accurate prediction of the scaling interdependencies between the electron density at the outer divertor entrance, the parallel energy flux density at the outer divertor entrance, and the impurity concentration in the outer divertor. However, the generalisation of these two key results to other machines, and in the presence of additional physics not included in these simulations, requires further studies. The analysis techniques described here provide a framework for such studies. Regarding the factor ∼4.3 overprediction of the simulated outer divertor impurity concentration, the main contributors to the disagreement are found to be other energy loss mechanisms besides impurity cooling (primarily neutral losses and radial transport) combined with convective energy fluxes near the target, as well as non-constant electron static pressure due to poloidally variable T i/T e. None of these are included in the Lengyel model. By themselves, these do not strongly influence the scaling interdependencies of the main Lengyel parameters over the explored parameter range. The impurity residence time τ is observed to increase with density, which tends to flatten out the impurity concentration scaling at low density, relative to the Lengyel model (which usually assumes constant τ). In these simulations, however, this flattening out was cancelled by an accumulation of other effects, so that the scaling prediction of the Lengyel model was still well met. A simple physics model is derived for n e τ that matches the simulation data well. Neon is found to migrate from the inner divertor to the outer divertor with increased puffing, thereby increasing the outer divertor neon enrichment. At outer target ion flux rollover, though, the enrichment is approximately independent of the upstream concentration, so that the Lengyel model predicts well the scaling dependency between the upstream impurity concentration and the upstream electron density, both key quantities dictating the operational range of a tokamak.}

The derived boundaries describe the operational space at the separatrix of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, which is presented in terms of an electron density and temperature existence diagram.

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {In future fusion reactors disruptions must be avoided at all costs. Disruptions due to the density limit (DL) are typically described by the power-independent Greenwald scaling. Recently, a power dependence of the disruptive DL was predicted by several authors (Zanca et al 2019 Nucl. Fusion 59 126011; Giacomin et al 2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 185003; Singh and Diamond 2022 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 64 084004; Stroth et al 2022 Nucl. Fusion 62 076008; Brown and Goldston 2021 Nucl. Mater. Energy 27 101002). It is investigated whether this increases the operational range of the tokamak. Increasing the heating power in the L-mode can induce an L-H transition, and therefore a power-dependent DL and the L-H transition cannot be considered independently. The different models are tested on a data base for separatrix parameters at the separatrix of ASDEX Upgrade and compared with the concept (SepOS) presented in Eich and Manz (2021 Nucl. Fusion 61 086017). The disruptive separatrix density scales with the power  in good agreement to all models. Also the back transition from high to low (H-L) confinement shows an approximately Greenwald scaling with an additional power dependence  according to the SepOS concept. For future devices operating at much higher heating power such a power scaling may allow operation at much higher separatrix densities than are common in H-mode operation. Preconditions to extrapolation for future devices are discussed.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {Divertor heat flux data from infra red (IR) from various tokamaks in H-Mode regime show that the power width, , scales approximately like 1.6 (R/a) ρs,pol. However, the IR based scaling comes with the restriction that only discharges were considered with attached divertor conditions. Here we set up a new data base covering low edge density data but also including high density plasmas reaching the H-mode density limit. We use Thomson-scattering to measure the electron temperature decay length which will set the near-SOL power width through parallel heat conduction. We present scaling results for the density, temperature and pressure separatrix fall-off lengths. As the principal result we derive a generalized power width scaling which reads as  where  describes a normalized collisionality (). The parameter  describes the relative importance of the interchange effect on drift-wave turbulence as proposed by Scott and is found to be closely linked to the diamagnetic parameter αd introduced by Rogers, Drake and Zeiler (RDZ). The edge operational space for ASDEX Upgrade displays a boundary qualitatively in agreement with the region labelled as density limit in the edge plasma phase space proposed by RDZ. The data base shows in the limit of low edge densities () accurate agreement to the IR based power width scaling. At elevated separatrix densities () the power width is broadened by a factor of up to about three accompanied by a reduction of the H98,y2 confinement factor. Plasmas with higher triangularity show higher values for H98,y2 in the same range of normalized collisionality.}

A significant broadening of the power fall-off length is observed, correlating to an increased separatrix density and pressure. Moreover, the possible reactor relevance of this regime is demonstrated by expanding the operational space to low edge safety factor and demonstrating the benign tungsten impurity behaviour. A discharge without any type-I ELM from start to end reaching a partially detached divertor at high normalised energy confinement time is presented.}

title = {A new scaling for divertor detachment},
journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {The ITER design, and future reactor designs, depend on divertor ‘detachment,’ whether partial, pronounced or complete, to limit heat flux to plasma-facing components and to limit surface erosion due to sputtering. It would be valuable to have a measure of the difficulty of achieving detachment as a function of machine parameters, such as input power, magnetic field, major radius, etc. Frequently the parallel heat flux, estimated typically as proportional to Psep/R or PsepB/R, is used as a proxy for this difficulty. Here we argue that impurity cooling is dependent on the upstream density, which itself must be limited by a Greenwald-like scaling. Taking this into account self-consistently, we find the impurity fraction required for detachment scales dominantly as power divided by poloidal magnetic field. The absence of any explicit scaling with machine size is concerning, as Psep surely must increase greatly for an economic fusion system, while increases in the poloidal field strength are limited by coil technology and plasma physics. This result should be challenged by comparison with 2D divertor codes and with measurements on existing experiments. Nonetheless, it suggests that higher magnetic field, stronger shaping, double-null operation, ‘advanced’ divertor configurations, as well as alternate means to handle heat flux such as metallic liquid and/or vapor targets merit greater attention.}

Its dependence on various plasma parameters has been tested for different plasma conditions in H-mode. The leading parameter determining ne,sep was found to be the neutral divertor pressure, which can be considered as an engineering parameter since it is determined mainly by the gas puff rate and the pumping speed.

Control. Fusion 58 045013). However, it is found that Ar radiates more efficiently and Ne less efficiently in the scrape-off layer than the model predicts. By separately increasing the neutral beam injection power and cutting the impurity gas flow, it is shown that the partially detached and strongly detached X-point radiator scenarios reattach in ≈100 ms and ≈250 ms, respectively. The former timescale is set by the core energy confinement time, whereas the latter has an additional delay caused by the time required for the ionisation front to move from the X-point to the target. A simple equation with scalable geometric terms to predict the ionisation front movement time in future machines is proposed.}
