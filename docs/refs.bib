	abstract = {Radiation and charge-exchange losses in the PLT tokamak are compared for discharges with Ohmic heating only (OH), and with additional heating by neutral beams (NB) or RF in the ion cyclotron frequency range (ICRF). Spectroscopic, bolometric and soft-X-ray diagnostics were used. The effects of discharge cleaning, vacuum wall gettering, and rate of gas inlet on radiation losses from OH plasmas and the correlation between radiation from plasma core and edge temperatures are discussed. – For discharges with neutral-beam injection the radiation dependence on type of injection (e.g. co-injection versus counter- and co- plus counter-injection) was investigated. Radial profiles of radiation loss were compared with profiles of power deposition. Although total radiation was in the range of 30–60\% of total input power into relatively clean plasma, nevertheless only 10–20\% of the total central input power to ions and electrons was radiated from the plasma core. The radiated power was increased mainly by increased influx of impurities, however, a fraction of this radiation was due to the change in charge-state distribution associated with charge-exchange recombination. – During ICRF heating radiation losses were higher than or comparable to those experienced during co- plus counter-injection at similar power levels. At these low power levels of ICRF heating the total radiated power was ∼ 80\% of auxiliary-heating power. Radiation losses changed somewhat less rapidly than linearly with ICRF power input up to the maximum available at the time of these measurements (0.65 MW).},

These particular boundaries of operation are derived in terms of a combination of dimensionless parameters describing interchange-drift-Alfvén turbulence without any free adjustable parameter. The derived boundaries describe the operational space at the separatrix of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, which is presented in terms of an electron density and temperature existence diagram. The derived density limits are compared against Greenwald scaling. The power threshold and role of ion heat flux for the transition to high confinement are discussed.}

title = {The power dependence of the maximum achievable H-mode and (disruptive) L-mode separatrix density in ASDEX Upgrade},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {In future fusion reactors disruptions must be avoided at all costs. Disruptions due to the density limit (DL) are typically described by the power-independent Greenwald scaling. Recently, a power dependence of the disruptive DL was predicted by several authors (Zanca et al 2019 Nucl. Fusion 59 126011; Giacomin et al 2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 185003; Singh and Diamond 2022 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 64 084004; Stroth et al 2022 Nucl. Fusion 62 076008; Brown and Goldston 2021 Nucl. Mater. Energy 27 101002). It is investigated whether this increases the operational range of the tokamak. Increasing the heating power in the L-mode can induce an L-H transition, and therefore a power-dependent DL and the L-H transition cannot be considered independently. The different models are tested on a data base for separatrix parameters at the separatrix of ASDEX Upgrade and compared with the concept (SepOS) presented in Eich and Manz (2021 Nucl. Fusion 61 086017). The disruptive separatrix density scales with the power  in good agreement to all models. Also the back transition from high to low (H-L) confinement shows an approximately Greenwald scaling with an additional power dependence  according to the SepOS concept. For future devices operating at much higher heating power such a power scaling may allow operation at much higher separatrix densities than are common in H-mode operation. Preconditions to extrapolation for future devices are discussed.}
